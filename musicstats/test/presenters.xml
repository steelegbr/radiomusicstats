										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rich is a recent addition to the team at Solid Radio. We caught up with him to find out a bit more about the man and mystery.</p>
<p>So, Rich, lets start with the basics. Tell us a bit about yourself.</p>
<blockquote><p>I was born in Strelly, Nottingham and moved to West Yorkshire in 1989. I&#8217;m now living in Saltire, a National heritage village near Skipton in North Yorkshire with Jon, my partner of 22 years and out two cats Malcolm and Brenda.</p>
<p>Jon and I got married in June 2014.</p></blockquote>
<p>How did you get involved in this radio stuff?</p>
<blockquote><p>When I moved to West Yorkshire in 1989, I got a job co-ordinating a charity fundraiser for Radio Aire in Leeds for three months. When that finished I trained up to monitor what was called <em>The Superstation</em>, which was an overnight radio service available to all commercial stations that didn&#8217;t have presenters from 10pm through 6am. My job was to play local commercials and radio ident jingles to make it sound like the service was coming from Radio Aire.</p>
<p>From there I co-presented a weekly show on Saturday afternoons called <em>The Saturday Gang</em> which went out on the FM frequency at the same time sport went out on the AM frequency.  That&#8217;s how I got the bug over 30 years ago when the music came from records and the jingles were played on an 8-track cart machine.</p></blockquote>
<p>We, erm, totally don&#8217;t remember the days of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidelipac">cart players</a>. Was it really all those years ago? How time flies.</p>
<p>On a slightly different topic, what are you watching on the telly?</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ll admit I don&#8217;t watch a great deal of TV as my evenings are tekan up working on my YouTube channel, which is a time consuming hobby of mine. However, I did watch the <em>The Crown</em> on Netflix, which I thought was amazing.</p>
<p>When it&#8217;s on I&#8217;m a big <em>Strictly</em> fan.</p></blockquote>
<p>What sort of music are you in to?</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m pretty much &#8220;stuck in an era&#8221; when it comes to bands. I don&#8217;t take much notice of current music. Most of my musical influences came from the eighties with bands like Bucks Fizz, Bananarama, Five State, Stock/Aitken/Waterman produced artists. Later on Sugababes and Girls Aloud. Safe to say my musical genre is pop.</p></blockquote>
<p>Is there anything you dislike?</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m sure this isn&#8217;t going to be a very popular dislike but mine is football. It was clear I at school I was never going to embrace it, so I played netball with the girls!</p></blockquote>
<p>Nothing wrong with being on the netball team. We totally weren&#8217;t the last to be picked for sports either&#8230;</p>
<p>As a final question, can you tell I two lies and one truth?</p>
<blockquote><p>When I first moved to West Yorkshire in 1989, I lived in a house next door to Mel B.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>I used to go to school with <a href="https://www.solidradio.co.uk/members/dave-stocks/">Dave Stocks</a>.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve seen all the Harry Potter files at least 10 times each.</p></blockquote>
<p>Tricky! I&#8217;m not sure which of these is the truth! Either way thanks Rich for your time and remember, you can catch him from 3pm Fridays on Solid Radio.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We caught up with the one and only Jennifer Jones with the hope of finding out a bit more about her unique character. Taking of which, ey up Jennifer!</p>
<blockquote><p><span id="cch_f7b48dbd051164" class="_mh6 _wsc"><span class="_3oh- _58nk">Welcome to Solid Radio. I;m Jennifer Jones. Are you sitting comfortably? Then I&#8217;ll begin.</span></span></p>
<p><span id="cch_f7b48dbd051164" class="_mh6 _wsc"><span class="_3oh- _58nk">I am so excited to be sharing a little about myself on the Solid Radio website! So shall we start with a little game? Here&#8217;s two truths and a lit about me:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>I am a natural blonde.</li>
<li>I have a degree in English and American Studies.</li>
<li>I am a published author.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Tricky&#8230; could be any of them.</p>
<blockquote><p><span id="cch_f7b48dbd051164" class="_mh6 _wsc"><span class="_3oh- _58nk">Do you think you know the truth? Well&#8230; I am not, in fact, a published author&#8230;yet! Although that is one of my life goals. You may not believe it, but I am in fact naturally blonde&#8230;at least, I was when I last saw my natural hair fifteen years ago! My hair is currently blue, although this is likely to change in the near future as it doesn&#8217;t stay the same colour for long!</span></span></p></blockquote>
<p>I bet the range of colours goes down well at work.</p>
<blockquote><p>Taking of work, w<span id="cch_f7b48dbd051164" class="_mh6 _wsc"><span class="_3oh- _58nk">henever someone asks what I do for a living, I tell them I&#8217;m a &#8220;vintage house witch&#8221;, or a &#8220;happy hippie homemaker&#8221;! I&#8217;m fortunate enough to be able to stay at home and look after my four gorgeous children (whom you may have already heard on Solid Radio!) and my equally gorgeous husband whom I married last year.</span></span></p></blockquote>
<p>Sounds busy. Manage to squeeze any hobbies in?</p>
<blockquote><p><span id="cch_f7b48dbd051164" class="_mh6 _wsc"><span class="_3oh- _58nk">I also started working in the care industry a few months ago, which is really rewarding ! I am a craftaholic &#8211; I love knitting, crochet, sewing and clay modelling, and I always have several projects in progress. It&#8217;s not uncommon to see me knitting away with a brew while my children are playing on Soft Play! I don&#8217;t watch much TV as I don&#8217;t really have the time, but my husband gave me the Twin Peaks box set for Christmas last year and I REALLY enjoyed watching that and solving the mysteries within &#8211; even though I was still left scratching my head by the finale!</span></span></p></blockquote>
<p>Got any favourite music genres?</p>
<blockquote><p><span id="cch_f7b48dbd051164" class="_mh6 _wsc"><span class="_3oh- _58nk">You may notice from my shows that my music taste is very eclectic! My only real musical &#8220;blind spot&#8221; is jazz, but I have a policy of listening to any song or artist once &#8211; after all,that&#8217;s how you discover new favourites! I love a track that I can really dance to &#8211; I am often caught dancing around my kitchen (which, according to my children, is really embarrassing), usually alternating between a sprightly(ish!) jive and a stylized bellydance, often with some headbanging thrown into the mix for good measure!</span></span></p></blockquote>
<p>Nothing like making the kids cringe with some proper parent dancing. Thanks for your time and giving us a bit more insight into your life Jennifer.</p>

<p>I think we&#8217;re getting an idea about who you are but could find out more about what you&#8217;re into. Can you tell us a bit about what your favourite things are?</p>
<blockquote><p>Music Genre &#8211; I like Indie stuff.</p>
<p>Food &#8211; Italian.</p>
<p>Film &#8211; As long as it&#8217;s British. Bend It Like Beckham, East is East, Full Monty, etc.</p>

<p>Any nicknames we should know about?</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve had all sorts of variants on my name. I&#8217;ve also been called Taggart (for obvious reasons) and even Machine once due to how I ate a sandwich.</p></blockquote>
<p>Where abouts do you hail from?</p>
<blockquote><p>Originally Fife but somewhat based in the Midlands now.</p></blockquote>
<p>Do you work?</p>
<blockquote><p>Yes. Designing computer networks and writing code.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think we’re getting an idea about who you are but could find out more about what you’re into. Can you tell us a bit about what your favourite things are?</p>
<blockquote><p>Music Genre &#8211; I&#8217;m into rock but fairly open when it comes to genre. Pop and even the odd classical song have made it onto my playlist before.</p>
<p>Food &#8211; I&#8217;m a sucker for Pizza. It&#8217;s about the only thing I couldn&#8217;t give up when losing weight.</p>
<p>Film &#8211; Hmm&#8230; Moon was quite good if a bit bleak. On the lighter side of things, I don&#8217;t mind the odd comedy with the Kingsman sequel being the most recent one.</p>
<p>Book &#8211; I quite enjoyed the Hitchhikers series but preferred the film!</p>
<p>Bands &#8211; Do I have to pick one?</p>
<p>Holiday Destination &#8211; I&#8217;d consider going back to New England some day. Closer to home, I&#8217;d literally have to head north of the border.</p>
<p>TV Show &#8211; Currently, I&#8217;m leaning towards Taskmaster.</p></blockquote>
<p>Can you tell us two truths and one lie?</p>
<blockquote><p>I achieved a Duke of Edinburgh Bronze award many, many years ago.</p>
<p>I once flew a glider solo, without crashing.</p>
<p>I once managed to not eat a whole pizza in one sitting.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well that&#8217;s a difficult one to decipher. Thanks Marc.</p>
